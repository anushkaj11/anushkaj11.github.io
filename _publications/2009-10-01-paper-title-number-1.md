title: "Contribution of Surface Energy to pH-Dependent Underwater Adhesion of an Acrylic Pressure-Sensitive Adhesive"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'We investigate how the presence of acrylic acid as a co-monomer impacts the adhesion of a model PSA in aqueous environments of varying pH. The adhesives under investigation are poly(2-ethylhexyl acrylate), or poly(2-EHA), and poly(2-EHA) co-polymerized with 5 wt % acrylic acid, or poly(2-EHA-co-AA). We characterize bonding and debonding (adhesion) of the adhesives using probe tack measurements with a spherical hydrophobic glass probe.'
